    <p>My favorite song is a 90s rap song called Lougin' by LL Cool J. It was on his 6th studio album Mr. Smith in 1995.
        The song itself is a boastful flirtatious plea to a woman he likes. She has a boyfriend, but he personally
        doesn't think he's treating her right only giving her money and clothes. The groove has a more famous remix
        which featured the R&B group Total.</p>

    <p>My favorite movie is Rush Hour 2. It stars Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan and is a comedy action film. This film
        improves on the first movie by making the characters familiar with each other working together to solve crime.
        A very funny film where James Carter and Inspector Lee stop a gang leader Ricky Tan.</p>
